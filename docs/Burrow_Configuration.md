## Installing Burrow Dependencies

* Issue the command `npm run burrow-deps` in the root folder to install the burrow NodeJS dependencies.
* The NPM package is in Alpha, so please contact us on RocketChat if you have any issues!

## Issues

Burrow integration is currently in an early phase of development so we are still to incorporate example smart contracts and chain queries. If you think you can help us out, please send a PR!
