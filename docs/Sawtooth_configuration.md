# Installing Sawtooth dependencies

* Install Sawtooth dependancies using `npm install` commands:
  * Issue the command  `npm run sawtooth-deps` in the root folder
  * If you want to test Sawtooth with a specific version such as v1.0.5, you should install directly,  
  e.g. `npm install protocol-buffers sawtooth-sdk@1.0.5` in Caliper's root folder.
