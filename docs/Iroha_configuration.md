> The latest supported version of Hyperledger Iroha is v1.0 beta-3

## Installing Iroha dependencies

* Install Iroha dependancies using `npm install` commands:
  * Issue the command  `npm run iroha-deps` in the root folder
  * If you want to test Iroha with a specific version such as v0.1.7, you should install directly,  
  e.g. `npm install --no-save iroha-lib@0.1.7` in Caliper's root folder.
* The package is in **alfa phase**, so if you have some problems with installing or compilation - please contact [Iroha maintainers](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues).
